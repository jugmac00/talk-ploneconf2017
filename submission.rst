Resource Registry Demystified

Plone's resource registry has changed significantly with Plone 5 and it's adoption of RequireJS and Less.js. We now have the ability to define JavaScript modules and their dependencies and use the power of LESS to better structure CSS code. And the next change to Webpack is already on the horizon.

This talk demystfies the resource registry by explaining it's concepts, outlining workflows to accomplish common integration tasks and giving tips and tricks to make it work for your project. We will also give an outlook to Webpack based resource bundling and which role the resource registry will play in the future.
